Presentation
============

Presentation is a bunch of script I use to make... html presentations. Instead of fighting powerpoint or ooimpress, I can write my presentation in the 
comfort of my text editor and have it formatted to an html file.

Requirements
============

A few python libraires are required to run presentation :
- textile
- jinja2

The directory layout
====================

Presentation uses 4 directories:
- presentation is the directory where will reside your slides. The slides must be sorted by order of apparition (for instance by prefixing them with their
  apparition order : 1-intro, 2-development, etc). This slides are formatted in textile markup.
- templates contain the template files used by pres.py to generate the presentation html
- js contains some static js source code
- static contains static files : images, stylesheets, etc
- output is where all the generated files go.


Running presentation
====================

Simply run the ./pres.py script in the root directory.
